## UX clarifications:

- Clean all followers on search button click?
- What to do when the first username is equal to the second username?
- Will there be only desktop users?

## TODOs/possible improvements:

In the project directory, you can run:
- Handle too many common followers(pagination/infinite list?)
- Handle an edgecase with whispaces(only whitespaces/a username starts with a space)
- If the app is planned to have extended functionality, move things from App into the components folder
- Add end-to-end tests
